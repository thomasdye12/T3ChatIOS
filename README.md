## AI Chat app for T3 Chat 


This app is not associated with T3 chat, however I have built this app to allow me to use it on my IOS device, it is not in any way feature complete with the web version. 

I hope that you enjoy this as much as I do, it is very much still in development, for photos see the photos folder above. 


If there are bugs or other issues, DO NOT report them to Theo or anyone at T3 chat, please leave a bug report here. 


I will happily welcome Pull requests.


If you are Theo, I wanna say I hope this is okay, if not please get in touch and I will take it down, but keep up the good work with the website and youtube, you have inspired me as a 21 year old dev who's background is in IOS and is now unemployed here in the UK.

Current working features:
Chat - supports only two models right now but more can be added easy - looking for an API for the info

chat history  - view all conversations history, no support for uploads and attachments yet. 
Chats are added to your account now

I Think thats it, right now. 

I am working on the following:
saving chats to your account
pinning and unpinning chats 
more models
other stuff that I can't remember 






If anyone has info on the following it would be helpful, 

How to associate chats with your account so they sync to the web, seems to be to do with the thread id, not connected to the websocket right now, 

Rest endpoint for getting previous chats,
Rest endpoint for getting chat history for a thread
